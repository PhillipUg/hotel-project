# Simple Hotel Simulation Project
This is a simple hotel project simulation i built while practicing Object Oriented Programming

## About project

In this simulation, we begin by asking the user to enter a name for a hotel, then a hotel object is created using the given input.  

Then, we proceed to ask for guests to check into our hotel which has 3 rooms(room1, room2 & room3))

When a guest is entered, we ask which room the guest wishes to be checked into and then proceed to add them to that particular room unless its full.

We continue this process until all rooms are filled with occupants.

**To try it out head over to Repl.it and simply click "RUN" (at the top of the page) to start the game, then follow the prompts in the repl.it terminal**
